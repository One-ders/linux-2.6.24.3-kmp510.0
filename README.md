SkyTC is a Chinese company that created a hand full of internet radio/tv player models and they are selling these under many different brand names on the market.
The devices are based on Linux but so far SkyTC has failed to supply the GPL code.

It is based on an Ingenic mips jz4750 processor.

After applying the ingenic patches on a 2.6.24.3 kernel, I have reverse engineerd the rest.

The wifi driver is still under work.
